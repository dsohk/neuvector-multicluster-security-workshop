# Lab 2 - Exploring Learning Behavior of NeuVector

In this task, we are going to explore the learning behavior of NeuVector to intelligently learn the behavior of any microservices application, automatically discover all the valid east-west network traffic within the cluster, and generate the security code as Kubernetes CRD resources.



Task 1 - Observe the behavior of the App from NV perspective in cluster1

* It's monitoring process, network, filesystem every pod is running.

* Demonstrate how the app behaves under discover, monitor and protect mode.

(Highlight learning behavior of NV and its benefits)

Task 3 - Export the policy under protect mode in cluster1

Task 4 - Import the policy into cluster 2

Task 5 - Validate your security posture.
